# Repetierer
Repetierer was created to enable teachers to test students by selecting a random individual from a list contained in an Excel file.
The teacher then has the ability to grade the student directly inside the application.
This grade will then be written in the Excel file containing the list of the students.
The algorithm's probability to select a specific student is based on the amount of times the student has already been tested and thus graded.

## Usage
(Note that the UI is currently in German, but feel free to add a translation as this project is Open-Source)
In addition to downloading the program there is also an Excel template file located in the repository and/or the releases.
Use said file as a template and edit it according to Your needs.
It currently supports up to 25 students (rows), a maximum six grades per student (columns) and infinite classes/subjects (individual worksheets).
The program itself is pretty self-explanatory.

## Future Development
I do not plan to continue this project any further, since I will soon finish the school for which I developed the application.
Of course the project is Open-Source so anyone can continue development.
